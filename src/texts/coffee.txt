You drink {3:coffeeperday} coffees :coffee: per day, at an average cost of ${3.00:price}: a weekly spend of ${=coffeeperday*price*7:weeklyspend}. :money_with_wings: Instead, you could buy a coffee machine for ${1000:machinecost}, and bags of {250.0:beanweight}g of coffee beans for ${15.00:beanprice}. At a dosage of {20.0:dosage}g per cup, you could get {=beanweight/dosage:cupsperbag} cups per bag, each costing ${=beanprice/cupsperbag:priceperhomemadecup}. This would bring your weekly coffee bill to ${=coffeeperday*7*priceperhomemadecup:weeklyhomespend} and the machine will pay for itself after {=machinecost/(weeklyspend-weeklyhomespend):result} weeks. :calendar:
