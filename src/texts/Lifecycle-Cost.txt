:scales: Sometimes, an expensive purchase can save you money in the long-term. Be lifecycle-cost sensitive versus purchase-price sensitive. For example...

:coffee: Say you drink {3:coffeeperday} coffees per day, at an average cost of ${3.00:price}. That's a weekly spend of ${=coffeeperday*price*7:weeklyspend}. :money_with_wings:

You could buy a fancy coffee machine for ${1000:machinecost}, and bags of {250.0:beanweight}g of coffee beans for ${15.00:beanprice}. At a dosage of {20.0:dosage}g per cup, you could get {=beanweight/dosage:cupsperbag} cups per bag, each costing ${=beanprice/cupsperbag:priceperhomemadecup}.

This would bring your weekly coffee bill to ${=coffeeperday*7*priceperhomemadecup:weeklyhomespend}. The coffee machine would pay for itself after {=machinecost/(weeklyspend-weeklyhomespend):result} weeks. :calendar:
